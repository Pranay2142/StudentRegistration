# StudentRegistration(Console-based)
GitHub Repository Description: 

This repository contains a simple Java program for managing student registration. The code is organized into three classes: Registration, Student, and Main.

**Registration Class:**
- Manages a list of students and provides methods to add, remove, view, update, and search for student details.
- Ensures that student IDs are unique to avoid duplicate entries.

**Student Class:**
- Represents the student entity with attributes such as student ID, name, and course.
- Provides getter and setter methods for these attributes.

**Main Class:**
- Demonstrates how to use the Registration class to create, add, and view student records.
- Provides a basic user interface for testing the functionality.

This code serves as a starting point for a student registration system and can be extended or modified as needed. Feel free to explore and use this code as a foundation for your Java projects related to student management.

To run the program, create an instance of the Registration class, add students, and interact with the provided methods.
